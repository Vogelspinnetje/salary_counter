#Salary Counter
With my new job, I ran into the problem that I can't see anywhere how many hours I worked. I work irregular days and hours. I can count the hours myself, but I'm far too lazy for that. So I wrote this program.

The usage is simple:
- You export your agenda in an .ics format (with iCalendar possible via Archive -> Export, be sure to select the right agenda).
- You run the program. The program asks your hourly salary; fill it in.
- You will get a .tsv file with every month and its hours and salaries.


**ONE VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:**
I really hope for you that your employer gives you breaks. This program is also designed to subtract your break time. Itâ€™s important to do the following in case you want to apply break time:

Put your break time in the description of each single event (workday). Fill in your break time in minutes. So half an hour break time means: `30`. If you put more than only numbers, the program will bathe in its own tears.
